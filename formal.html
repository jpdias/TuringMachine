A Turing machine is formally defined (one-tape) as a 7-tuple M= \langle Q, \Gamma, b, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F \rangle where

    Q is a finite, non-empty set of states
    \Gamma is a finite, non-empty set of the tape alphabet/symbols
    b \in \Gamma is the blank symbol (the only symbol allowed to occur on the tape infinitely often at any step during the computation)
    \Sigma\subseteq\Gamma\setminus\{b\} is the set of input symbols
    q_0 \in Q is the initial state
    F \subseteq Q is the set of final or accepting states.
    \delta: Q \setminus F \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\} is a partial function called the transition function, where L is left shift, R is right shift. (A relatively uncommon variant allows "no shift", say N, as a third element of the latter set.)

Anything that operates according to these specifications is a Turing machine.
